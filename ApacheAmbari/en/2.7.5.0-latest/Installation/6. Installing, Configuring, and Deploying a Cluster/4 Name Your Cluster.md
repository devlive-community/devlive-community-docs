### Steps

1. In **Name your cluster**, type a name for the cluster you want to create.

   Use no white spaces or special characters in the name.

   > If you plan to Kerberize the cluster, consider limiting the cluster name (to 12 characters or less), to accommodate the fact that Kerberos principals will be appended to the cluster name string and that some identity providers impose a limit on the total principal name length.

2. Choose **Next**.
