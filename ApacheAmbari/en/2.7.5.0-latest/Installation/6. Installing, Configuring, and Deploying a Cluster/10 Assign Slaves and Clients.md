The Cluster Install wizard assigns the slave components, such as DataNodes, NodeManagers, and RegionServers, to appropriate hosts in your cluster. It also attempts to select hosts for installing the appropriate set of clients.

### Steps

1. Use **all** or **none** to select all of the hosts in the column or none of the hosts, respectively.

    If a host has an asterisk next to it, that host is also running one or more master components. Hover your mouse over the asterisk to see which master components are on that host.

2. Fine-tune your selections by using the check boxes next to specific hosts.

3. When you are satisfied with your assignments, choose **Next**.
