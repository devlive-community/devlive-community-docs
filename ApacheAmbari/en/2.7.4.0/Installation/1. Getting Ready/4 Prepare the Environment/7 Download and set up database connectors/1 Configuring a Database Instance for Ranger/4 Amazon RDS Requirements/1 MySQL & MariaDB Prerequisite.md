You must change the variable `log_bin_trust_function_creators` to `1` during Ranger installation.

From RDS Dashboard>Parameter group (on the left side of the page):

1. Set the MySQL Server variable `log_bin_trust_function_creators` to `1`.
2. (Optional) After Ranger installation is complete, reset `log_bin_trust_function_creators` to its original setting. The variable is only required to be set to `1` during Ranger installation.
