Based on your Internet access, choose one of the following options:

- No Internet Access

    This option involves downloading the repository tarball, moving the tarball to the selected mirror server in your cluster, and extracting the tarball to create the repository.

- Temporary Internet Access

  This option involves using your temporary Internet access to synchronize (using reposync) the software packages to your selected mirror server to create the repository.

  Both options proceed in a similar, straightforward way. Setting up for each option presents some key differences, as described in the following sections:
