Management packs allow you to deploy a range of services to your Ambari-managed cluster. You can use a management pack to deploy a specific component or service, or to deploy an entire platform, like HDF.

In general, when working with management packs, you perform the following tasks in this order:

1. Install the management pack.
2. Update the repository URL in Ambari.
3. Start the Ambari Server.
4. Launch the Ambari Installation Wizard.
