[TOC]

Components like Druid, Hive, Ranger, Oozie, and Superset require an operational database. During installation, you have the option to use an existing database or have Ambari install a new instance, in the case of Hive. For Ambari to connect to the database of your choice, you must download the necessary database drivers and connectors directly from the database vendor before installing the component. To better prepare for your install or upgrade, set up the database connectors as you set up your environment.
