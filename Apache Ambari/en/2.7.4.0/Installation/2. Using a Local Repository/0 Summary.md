If your enterprise clusters have limited outbound Internet access, you should consider using a local repository, which enables you to benefit from more governance and better installation performance. You can also use a local repository for routine post-installation cluster operations such as service start and restart operations. Using a local repository includes Accessing Cloudera Repositories , setting up the repository using either no internet access or limited internet access, and preparing the Apache Ambari repository configuration file to use your new local repository.
