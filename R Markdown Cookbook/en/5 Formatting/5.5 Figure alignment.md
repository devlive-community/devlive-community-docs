The chunk option `fig.align` specifies the alignment of figures. For example, you can center images with `fig.align = 'center'`, or right-align images with `fig.align = 'right'`. This option works for both HTML and LaTeX output, but may not work for other output formats (such as Word, unfortunately). It works for both plots drawn from R code chunks and external images included via `knitr::include_graphics()`.
