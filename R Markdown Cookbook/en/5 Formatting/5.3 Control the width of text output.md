Sometimes the text output printed from R code may be too wide. If the output document has a fixed page width (e.g., PDF documents), the text output may exceed the page margins. See Figure [5.1](#fig51) for an example.

The R global option `width` can be used to control the width of printed text output from some R functions, and you may try a smaller value if the default is too large. This option typically indicates a rough number of characters per line (except for East Asian languages). For example:

    The output is too wide in this chunk:
    
    ```{r}
    options(width = 300)
    matrix(runif(100), ncol = 20)
    ```
    
    The output of this chunk looks better:
    
    ```{r}
    options(width = 60)
    matrix(runif(100), ncol = 20)
    ```

Not all R functions respect the `width` option. If this option does not work, your only choice may be to wrap the long lines of text. This is actually the default behavior of the `html_document` output format. If the HTML output format that you are using does not wrap the long lines, you may apply the CSS code below (see Section [7.1]($Apply-Custom-CSS) for instructions):

    pre code {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
    }

For PDF output, it is trickier to wrap the lines. One solution is to use the LaTeX package **listings**, which can be enabled via the Pandoc argument `--listings`. Then you have to set an option for this package, and the setup code can be included from an external LaTeX file (see Section [6.1]($Add-LaTeX-Code-To-The-Preamble) for how), e.g.,

    ---
    output:
      pdf_document:
        pandoc_args: --listings
        includes:
          in_header: preamble.tex
    ---

In `preamble.tex`, we set an option of the **listings** package:

    \lstset{
      breaklines=true
    }

If you do not like the appearance of code blocks with **listings**, you can set up other **listings** options in `\lstset{}`, e.g., you may change the font family with `basicstyle=\ttfamily`. You can find more information about this package in its documentation: [https://ctan.org/pkg/listings](https://ctan.org/pkg/listings).

Figure [5.1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/text-width.html#fig:wrap-text-1) shows the default `pdf_document` output that contains wide text, which exceeds the page margin. Figure [5.2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/text-width.html#fig:wrap-text-2) shows the PDF output when we use the **listings** package to wrap the text.
