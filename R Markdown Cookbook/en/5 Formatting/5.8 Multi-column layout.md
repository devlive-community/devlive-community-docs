Pandoc’s Markdown supports the multi-column layout for slides but not other types of documents. In this recipe, we show how to use the multi-column layout in normal HTML documents and LaTeX documents. This recipe was inspired by Atsushi Yasumoto’s solutions to the **knitr** issue [https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1743](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1743).

The recipe will be much simpler if you only need to consider HTML output, because arranging HTML elements side by side is relatively simple via CSS. It will be even simpler if you only need to arrange the text output of a code chunk side by side. Below is the first example:

    ---
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    ```{r attr.source="style='display:inline-block;'", collapse=TRUE}
    1:10  # a sequence from 1 to 10
    10:1  # in the reverse order
    ```

The CSS attribute `display: inline-block;` means the output code blocks (i.e., the `<pre>` tags in HTML) should be displayed as inline elements. By default, these blocks are displayed as block-level elements (i.e., `display: block;`) and will occupy whole rows. The chunk option `collapse = TRUE` means the text output will be merged into the R source code block, so both the source and its text output will be placed in the same `<pre>` block.

If you want to arrange arbitrary content side by side in HTML output, you can use Pandoc’s [fenced `Div`.](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) The name “Div” comes from the HTML tag `<div>`, but you can interpret it as an arbitrary block or container. A `Div` starts and ends with three or more colons (e.g., `:::`). A `Div` with more colons can contain `Div`s with fewer colons. An important and useful feature of the fenced `Div` is that you can attach attributes to it. For example, you can apply the CSS attribute `display: flex;` to an outside container, so that the inside containers will be placed side by side:

    ---
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    :::: {style="display: flex;"}
    
    ::: {}
    Here is the **first** Div.
    
    ```{r}
    str(iris)
    ```
    :::
    
    ::: {}
    And this block will be put on the right:
    
    ```{r}
    plot(iris[, -5])
    ```
    :::
    
    ::::

In the above example, the outside `Div` (`::::`) contains two `Div`s (`:::`). You can certainly add more `Div`s inside. To learn more about the very powerful CSS attribute `display: flex;` (CSS Flexbox), you may read the guide at [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). The CSS Grid (`display: grid;`) is also very powerful and can be used in the above example, too. If you want to try it, you may change `display: flex;` to `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;`. See the guide at [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) if you want to learn more about the grid layout.

It is trickier if you want the layout to work for both HTML and LaTeX output. We show a full example below that works for HTML documents, LaTeX documents, and Beamer presentations:

    ---
    output:
      html_document: 
        css: columns.css
      pdf_document: 
        keep_tex: true
        includes:
          in_header: columns.tex
      beamer_presentation: 
        keep_tex: true
        includes:
          in_header: columns.tex
    ---
    
    # Two columns
    
    Below is a Div containing three child Divs side by side. The Div
    in the middle is empty, just to add more space between the left
    and right Divs.
    
    :::::: {.cols data-latex=""}
    
    ::: {.col data-latex="{0.55\textwidth}"}
    ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
    par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
    plot(cars, pch = 19)
    ```
    :::
    
    ::: {.col data-latex="{0.05\textwidth}"}
    \ 
    <!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as
    a column separator -->
    :::
    
    ::: {.col data-latex="{0.4\textwidth}"}
    The figure on the left-hand side shows the `cars` data.

<div id="fig53">
FIGURE 5.3: A two-column layout that works for HTML, LaTeX, and Beamer output.
</div>

Figure [5.3](#fig53) shows the output. In this example, we used an outside `Div` with the class `.cols` and three inside `Div`s with the class `.col`. For HTML output, we introduced an external CSS file `columns.css`, in which we applied the Flexbox layout to the outside `Div` so the inside `Div`s can be placed side by side:

For LaTeX output (`pdf_document`), we have to introduce some dirty hacks stored in `columns.tex` to the LaTeX preamble to define the LaTeX environments `cols` and `col`:

    \newenvironment{cols}[1][]{}{}
    
    \newenvironment{col}[1]{\begin{minipage}{#1}\ignorespaces}{%
    \end{minipage}
    \ifhmode\unskip\fi
    \aftergroup\useignorespacesandallpars}
    
    \def\useignorespacesandallpars#1\ignorespaces\fi{%
    #1\fi\ignorespacesandallpars}
    
    \makeatletter
    \def\ignorespacesandallpars{%
      \@ifnextchar\par
        {\expandafter\ignorespacesandallpars\@gobble}%
        {}%
    }
    \makeatother

The `col` environment is particularly complicated mainly because Pandoc starts a new paragraph for each `Div` in LaTeX output, and we have to remove these new paragraphs. Otherwise, the `Div`s cannot be placed side by side. The hacks were borrowed from [https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/179016/9128](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/179016/9128).

For Beamer output, we apply the same hacks in `columns.tex`. Please note that Pandoc has provided some special `Div`’s for [slide shows,](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc) such as `::: {.columns}`, `::: {.column}`, and `::: {.incremental}`. Because they already have their special meanings, you must be careful _not_ to use these types of `Div`’s if you intend to convert a `Div` to a LaTeX environment in the way mentioned in this section. That is why we did not use the `Div` types `columns` or `column`, but chose to use `cols` and `col` instead.
