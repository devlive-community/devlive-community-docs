The size of plots made in R can be controlled by the chunk option `fig.width` and `fig.height` (in inches). Equivalently, you can use the `fig.dim` option to specify the width and height in a numeric vector of length 2, e.g., `fig.dim = c(8, 6)` means `fig.width = 8` and `fig.height = 6`. These options set the physical size of plots, and you can choose to display a different size in the output using chunk options `out.width` and `out.height`, e.g., `out.width = "50%"`.

If a plot or an image is not generated from an R code chunk, you can include it in two ways:

*   Use the Markdown syntax `![caption](path/to/image)`. In this case, you can set the size of the image using the `width` and/or `height` attributes, e.g.,

        We include an image in the next paragraph:
        
        ![A nice image.](foo/bar.png){width=50%}

*   Use the **knitr** function `knitr::include_graphics()` in a code chunk. You can use chunk options such as `out.width` and `out.height` for this chunk, e.g.,

        We include an external image with the R function:
        
        ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="A nice image."}
        knitr::include_graphics("foo/bar.png")
        ```


We used the width `50%` in the above examples, which means half of the width of the image container (if the image is directly contained by a page instead of a child element of the page, that means half of the page width). If you know that you only want to generate the image for a specific output format, you can use a specific unit. For example, you may use `300px` if the output format is HTML.
