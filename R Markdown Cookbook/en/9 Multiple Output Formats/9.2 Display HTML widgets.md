HTML widgets ([https://www.htmlwidgets.org](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)) are typically interactive JavaScript applications, which only work in HTML output. If you knit an Rmd document containing HTML widgets to a non-HTML format such as PDF or Word, you may get an error message like this:

    Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document
    targeting X output. Please change the output type of this
    document to HTML. Alternatively, you can allow HTML output in
    non-HTML formats by adding this option to the YAML front-matter
    of your rmarkdown file:
    
      always_allow_html: yes
    
    Note however that the HTML output will not be visible in
    non-HTML formats.

There is actually a better solution than the one mentioned in the above error message, but it involves extra packages. You can install the **webshot** package ([Chang 2023](#ref-R-webshot)) in R and also install PhantomJS:

    install.packages("webshot")
    webshot::install_phantomjs()

Then if you knit an Rmd document with HTML widgets to a non-HTML format, the HTML widgets will be displayed as static screenshots. The screenshots are automatically taken in **knitr**. [Section 2.10]($) of the **bookdown** book contains more information on finer control over the screenshots.
