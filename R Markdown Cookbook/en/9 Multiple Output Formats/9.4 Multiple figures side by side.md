You can place multiple figures side by side using the `fig.show="hold"` along with the `out.width` option. In the example below, we have set `out.width="50%"` (see Figure [9.2](#fig:figures-side) for the output):

    ```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
    par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
    plot(cars)
    plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, pch = 19)
    ```

<div id="fig:figures-side">
FIGURE 9.2: Side-by-side figures.
</div>

This simple approach works for both PDF and HTML output.

If you want to use sub-figures when there are multiple plots in a figure, you may see Section [6.6]($LaTeX-Sub-Figures), but please note that sub-figures are only supported in LaTeX output.
