If you have the **webshot** package ([Chang 2023](#ref-R-webshot)) and PhantomJS installed (see Section [9.2]($Display-HTML-Widgets)), you can embed any web page in the output document through `knitr::include_url()`. When you pass a URL of a web page to this function in a code chunk, it will generate an `<iframe>` (inline frame) if the output format is HTML, and a screenshot of the web page for other output formats. You can view the actual page in the inline frame. For example, Figure [9.1](#fig:include-url) should show you my homepage if you are reading the online version of this book, otherwise you will see a static screenshot instead.

    knitr::include_url("https://yihui.org")

<div id="fig:include-url"></div>
FIGURE 9.1: Embed Yihui’s homepage as an iframe or screenshot.
</div>

Most chunk options related to figures also work for `knitr::include_url()`, such as `out.width` and `fig.cap`.

If you have published a Shiny app publicly on a server, you can use `knitr::include_app()` to include it, which works in the same way as `include_url()`. [Section 2.11](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/web-pages-and-shiny-apps.html) of the **bookdown** book ([Xie 2016](#ref-bookdown2016)) contains more details about `include_app()` and `include_url()`.
