We can use **bookdown** ([Xie 2023a](#ref-R-bookdown)) output formats to add figure numbers to their captions. Below is an example:

    ---
    output: bookdown::html_document2
    ---

    ```{r cars, fig.cap = "An amazing plot"}
    plot(cars)
    ```
    
    ```{r mtcars, fig.cap = "Another amazing plot"}
    plot(mpg ~ hp, mtcars)
    ```

Section [4.7]($Cross-referencing-Within-Documents) demonstrates how this works for other elements such as tables and equations, and how to cross-reference the numbered elements within the text. Besides `html_document2`, there are several other similar functions for other output formats, such as `pdf_document2` and `word_document2`.

You can add this feature to R Markdown output formats outside **bookdown**, too. The key is to use those formats as the “base formats” of **bookdown** output formats. For example, to number and cross-reference figures in the `rticles::jss_article` format, you can use:

    output:
      bookdown::pdf_book:
        base_format: rticles::jss_article

Please read the help pages of the **bookdown** output format functions to see if they have the `base_format` argument (e.g., `?bookdown::html_document2`).
