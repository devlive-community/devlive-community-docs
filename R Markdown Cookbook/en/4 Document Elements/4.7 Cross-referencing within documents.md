Cross-referencing is a useful way of directing your readers through your document, and can be automatically done within R Markdown. While this has been explained in [Chapter 2]($ConceptualOverview) from the **bookdown** book, we want to present a brief summary below.

To use cross-references, you will need:

*   **A bookdown output format**: Cross-referencing is not provided directly within the base **rmarkdown** package, but is provided as an extension in **bookdown** ([Xie 2023a](#ref-R-bookdown)). We must therefore use an output format from **bookdown** (e.g., `html_document2`, `pdf_document2`, and `word_document2`, etc.) in the YAML `output` field.

*   **A caption to your figure (or table)**: Figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure.

*   **A labeled code chunk**: This provides the identifier for referencing the figure generated by the chunk.


After these conditions are met, we can make cross-references within the text using the syntax `\@ref(type:label)`, where `label` is the chunk label and `type` is the environment being referenced (e.g. `tab`, `fig`, or `eq`). An example is provided below:

    ---
    title: Cross-referencing figures, tables, and equations
    author: Generated by bookdown
    output:
      bookdown::html_document2: default
      bookdown::pdf_document2: default
    ---
    
    See Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot).
    
    ```{r cars-plot, fig.cap="The cars data.", echo=FALSE}
    par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1))
    plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
    ```
    
    Also see Equation \@ref(eq:mean).
    
    \begin{equation}
    \bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} (\#eq:mean)
    \end{equation}
    
    And see Table \@ref(tab:mtcars).
    
    ```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE}
    knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "The mtcars data.")
    ```

The output of this document is shown in Figure [4.2](#fig42).

You can also cross-reference equations, theorems, and section headers. These types of references are explained further in Section 2.2 and Section 2.6 of the **bookdown** book.
