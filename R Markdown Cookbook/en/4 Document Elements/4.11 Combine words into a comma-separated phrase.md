When you want to output a character vector for humans to read (e.g., `x <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")`), you probably do not want something like `[1] "apple" "banana" "cherry"`, which is the normal way to print a vector in R. Instead, you may want a character string “`apple, banana, and cherry`”. There is a base R function, `paste()`, that you can use to concatenate a character vector into a single string, e.g., `paste(x, collapse = ', ')`, and the output will be `"apple, banana, cherry"`. The problems are (1) the conjunction “and” is missing, and (2) when the vector only contains two elements, we should not use commas (e.g., the output should be `"apple and banana"` instead of `"apple, banana"`).

The function `knitr::combine_words()` can be used to concatenate words into a phrase regardless of the length of the character vector. Basically, for a single word, it will just return this word; for two words A and B, it returns `"A and B"`; for three or more words, it returns `"A, B, C, ..., Y, and Z"`. The function also has a few arguments that can customize the output. For example, if you want to output the words in pairs of backticks, you may use ``knitr::combine_words(x, before = '`')``. Below are more examples with different arguments, and please see the help page `?knitr::combine_words` if the meaning of any argument is not clear from the output here:

    v <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    knitr::combine_words(v)
    ## apple, banana, and cherry
    knitr::combine_words(v, before = "`", after = "'")
    ## `apple', `banana', and `cherry'
    knitr::combine_words(v, and = "")
    ## apple, banana, cherry
    knitr::combine_words(v, sep = " / ", and = "")
    ## apple / banana / cherry
    knitr::combine_words(v[1])  # a single word
    ## apple
    knitr::combine_words(v[1:2])  # two words
    ## apple and banana
    knitr::combine_words(LETTERS[1:5])
    ## A, B, C, D, and E

This function can be particularly handy when it is used in an inline R expression, e.g.,

    This morning we had `r knitr::combine_words(v)` for breakfast.
