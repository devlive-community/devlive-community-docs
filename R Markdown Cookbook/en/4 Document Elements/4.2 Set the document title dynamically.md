You can use inline R code (see Section [3.1]($Code-Chunks-And-Inline-R-Code)) anywhere in an Rmd document, including the YAML metadata section. This means some YAML metadata can be dynamically generated with inline R code, such as the document title. For example:

    ---
    title: "An analysis of `r nrow(mtcars)` cars"
    ---

If your title depends on an R variable created later in the document, you may add the `title` field in a later YAML section, e.g., the following:

    ---
    author: "Smart Analyst"
    output: pdf_document
    ---
    
    I just tried really hard to calculate our market share:
    
    ```{r}
    share <- runif(1)
    ```
    
    ---
    title: "Our market share is `r round(100 * share, 2)`% now!"
    ---
    
    I feel `r if(share > 0.8) "happy" else "sad"` about it.

In the example above, we added the document title after we created the variable `share`. The title works in this case because Pandoc can read any number of YAML sections in a document (and merge them).

You can also generate titles or any YAML fields dynamically from parameters in parameterized reports (see Section [17.4]($Parameterized-Reports)), e.g.,

    ---
    title: "`r params$doc_title`"
    author: "Smart Analyst"
    params:
      doc_title: "The Default Title"
    ---

With the title being a dynamic parameter, you can easily generate a batch of reports with different titles.

We used the title as the example in this section, but the idea can be applied to any metadata fields in the YAML section.
