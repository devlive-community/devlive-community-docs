[TOC]

If you do not want certain section headings to be included in the table of contents, you can add two classes to the heading: `unlisted` and `unnumbered`. For example:

    # Section heading {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Note that this feature requires at least Pandoc 2.10. You may check your Pandoc version via `rmarkdown::pandoc_version()`. If the version is lower than 2.10, you may install a newer version (see Section [1.1]($Use-A-Pandoc-Version-Not-Bundled-With-The-RStudio-IDE)).
