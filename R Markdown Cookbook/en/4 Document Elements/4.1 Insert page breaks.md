When you want to break a page, you can insert the command `\newpage` in the document. It is a LaTeX command, but the **rmarkdown** package is able to recognize it for both LaTeX output formats and a few non-LaTeX output formats including HTML,[5](#fn5) Word, and ODT. For example:

    ---
    title: Breaking pages
    output:
      pdf_document: default
      word_document: default
      html_document: default
      odt_document: default
    ---
    
    # The first section
    
    \newpage
    
    # The second section

This feature is based on Pandoc’s Lua filters (see Section [4.20]($Manipulate-Markdown-Via-Pandoc-Lua-Filters)). For those who are interested in the technology, you may view this package vignette:

    vignette("lua-filters", package = "rmarkdown")

<div id="fn5">
5. For HTML output, page breaks only make sense when you print the HTML page, otherwise you will not see the page breaks, because an HTML page is just a single continuous page.↩︎
</div>
