If you want the date on which the Rmd document is compiled to be reflected in the output report, you can add an inline R expression to the `date` field in YAML, and use the `Sys.Date()` or `Sys.time()` function to obtain the current date, e.g.,

You may want to specify the desired date or date-time format to make it more human-readable, e.g.,

    date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"

This will generate the date dynamically each time you knit your document, e.g., 29 February, 2024. If you wish to customize the format of the dates, you can alter the time format by providing your own format string. Here are some examples:

*   `%B %Y`: February 2024
*   `%d/%m/%y`: 29/02/24
*   `%a/%d/%b`: Thu 29 Feb

A full table of POSIXct formats is shown in Table [4.1](#tab-date-format).

As a final note, you may also want to include some explanatory text along with the date. You can add any text such as “Last compiled on” before the R code as follows:

    date: "Last compiled on `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
