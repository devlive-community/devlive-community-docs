[TOC]

We can add multiple authors to an R Markdown document within the YAML frontmatter in a number of ways. If we simply want to list them on the same line, we can provide a single string to the document, e.g.,

    ---
    title: "Untitled"
    author: "John Doe, Jane Doe"
    ---

Alternatively, if we wish each entry to be on its own line, we can provide a list of entries to the YAML field. This can be useful if you wish to include further information about each author such as an email address or institution, e.g.,

    ---
    author:
      - John Doe, Institution One
      - Jane Doe, Institution Two
    ---

We can make use of the Markdown syntax `^[]` to add additional information as a footnote to the document. This may be more useful if you have extended information that you wish to include for each author, such as providing a contact Email and address. The exact behavior will depend on the output format:

    ---
    author:
      - John Doe^[Institution One, john@example.org]
      - Jane Doe^[Institution Two, jane@example.org]
    ---

Certain R Markdown templates will allow you to specify additional parameters directly within the YAML. For example, the [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) output format allows `url`, `affiliation`, and `affiliation_url` to be specified. After you install the **distill** package ([Dervieux et al. 2023](#ref-R-distill)):

    install.packages("distill")

you can use the Distill format with detailed author information, e.g.,

    ---
    title: "Distill for R Markdown"
    author:
      - name: "JJ Allaire"
        url: https://github.com/jjallaire
        affiliation: RStudio
        affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
    output: distill::distill_article
    ---
