When an Rmd document is compiled, all of its metadata in the YAML section will be stored in the list object `rmarkdown::metadata`. For example, `rmarkdown::metadata$title` gives you the title of the document. You can use this `metadata` object in your R code, so that you do not need to hard-code information that has been provided in the YAML metadata. For example, when you send an email with the **blastula** package ([Iannone and Cheng 2024](#ref-R-blastula)) within an Rmd document, you may use the title of the document as the email subject, and get the sender information from the author field:

    ---
    title: An important report
    author: John Doe
    email: john@example.com
    ---
    
    We have done an important analysis, and want to email
    the results.
    
    ```{r}
    library(rmarkdown)
    library(blastula)
    smtp_send(
      ...,
      from = setNames(metadata$email, metadata$author),
      subject = metadata$title
    )
    ```
