Pandoc converts Markdown to LaTeX through a template. The template is a LaTeX file containing Pandoc variables, and Pandoc will replace these variables with their values. Below is a simple template that only contains a single variable `$body$`:

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    $body$
    \end{document}

The value of `$body$` is the LaTeX code generated from the body of the Markdown document. For example, if the body text is `Hello **world**!` in Markdown, the value of `$body$` will be `Hello \textbf{world}!`.

If the LaTeX customization methods in Sections [6.1]($Add-LaTeX-Code-To-The-Preamble), [6.2]($Pandoc-Options-ForLaTeX-Output), and [6.4]($Include-Additional-LaTeX-Packages) are not enough for you, you may try to use a custom template instead. A template allows you to use arbitrary LaTeX code in it, and hence is much more flexible. To use a template, include the path of the template in the `template` option of `pdf_document`, e.g.,

    output:
      pdf_document:
        template: my-template.tex

The default LaTeX template of Pandoc can be found at [https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/tree/master/data/templates](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/tree/master/data/templates) (named `default.latex`). If you want to create your own template, you may want to start with this template.

For the full list of Pandoc variables and their meanings (such as `$body$` and `$title$`), see Pandocâ€™s manual at [https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates). You can also use arbitrary custom variables, which are typically passed to the template from the YAML metadata. If you want to learn by examples, you may take a look at the **MonashEBSTemplates** package ([https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashEBSTemplates](https://github.com/robjhyndman/MonashEBSTemplates)), which has provided several custom LaTeX templates. These templates are under the `inst/rmarkdown/templates/*/resources/` directories (here `*` denotes the template names). For example, the template for the output format `MonashEBSTemplates::memo` allows you to use a variable `branding` in the YAML metadata to control whether to include the brand logo of Monash University. This is achieved by an `if` statement in the template that looks like this:

    $if(branding)$%
    \includegraphics[height=1.5cm]{monash2}
    \vspace*{-0.6cm}
    $else$
    \vspace*{-1cm}
    $endif$
