The use of additional LaTeX packages can allow for extensive customization of document styling. In addition, several packages such as **kableExtra** ([Zhu 2024](#ref-R-kableExtra)) may have LaTeX dependencies for the R package to function. Much like R, we need to load packages within the R Markdown document before we are able to use their functions.

### 6.4.1 Loading LaTeX packages[](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-extra.html#loading-latex-packages)

We can load additional LaTeX packages using the `extra_dependencies` option within the `pdf_document` YAML settings. This allows us to provide a list of LaTeX packages to be loaded in the intermediate LaTeX output document, e.g.,

    ---
    title: "Using more LaTeX packages"
    output: 
      pdf_document:
        extra_dependencies: ["bbm", "threeparttable"]
    ---

If you need to specify options when loading the package, you can add a second level to the list and provide the options as a list, e.g.,

    output: 
      pdf_document:
        extra_dependencies:
          caption: ["labelfont={bf}"]
          hyperref: ["unicode=true", "breaklinks=true"]
          lmodern: null

For those familiar with LaTeX, this is equivalent to the following LaTeX code:

    \usepackage[labelfont={bf}]{caption} 
    \usepackage[unicode=true, breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
    \usepackage{lmodern}

The advantage of using the `extra_dependencies` argument over the `includes` argument introduced in Section [6.1]($Add-LaTeX-Code-To-The-Preamble) is that you do not need to include an external file, so your Rmd document can be self-contained.

### 6.4.2 Example packages[](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-extra.html#example-packages)

There is an extensive community for LaTeX, and there are over 4,000 packages available through the [Comprehensive TeX Archive Network](https://ctan.org/) (CTAN). Here are some examples of LaTeX packages you could consider using within your report:

*   [pdfpages](https://ctan.org/pkg/pdfpages): Include full PDF pages from an external PDF document within your document.
*   [caption](https://ctan.org/pkg/caption): Change the appearance of caption subtitles. For example, you can make the figure title italic or bold.
*   [fancyhdr](https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr): Change the style of running headers of all pages.
