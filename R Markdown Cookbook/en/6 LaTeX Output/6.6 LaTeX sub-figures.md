Sometimes you may want to include multiple images in a single figure environment. Sub-figures allow us to achieve this by arranging multiple images within a single environment and providing each with its own sub-caption.

Sub-figures require the LaTeX package **subfig**. We can load it via the `extra_dependencies` YAML option within the `pdf_document` output. For example:

    ---
    output:
      pdf_document:
        extra_dependencies: "subfig"
    ---

To arrange all plots from a code chunk in sub-figures, you have to use the chunk options `fig.cap` (the caption for the whole figure environment) and `fig.subcap` (a character vector of the captions for sub-figures). For best output, you can also use the following options:

*   `fig.ncol`: The number of columns of sub-figures. By default, all plots are arranged in a single row. You can break them into multiple rows.

*   `out.width`: The output width of individual plots. You will normally set this to `100%` divided by the number of columns. For example, if you have two plots, the `out.width` option should be equal to or less than `50%`, otherwise the plots may exceed the page margin.


Below is an illustrative example:

    ---
    output:
      pdf_document:
        extra_dependencies: "subfig"
    ---

    ```{r, fig.cap='Figure 1', fig.subcap=c('(a)', '(b)', '(c)')}
    plot(1:10)
    plot(cars, pch = 19)
    boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
    ```

The output is shown in Figure [6.2](#fig62). For the sake of simplicity, we omitted a few chunk options in the chunk header of the above example, including `fig.ncol = 2`, `out.width = "50%"`, `fig.align = "center"`, and the actual long captions.
