If you run into an error like this:

    ! Package inputenc Error:
      Unicode char \u8: not set up for use with LaTeX.

it probably means that you are using the default LaTeX engine, `pdflatex`, to render the (intermediate `.tex`) document to PDF, which was unable to process certain Unicode characters in your document. If that is the case, you may switch to `xelatex` or `lualatex`, e.g.,

    output:
      pdf_document:
        latex_engine: xelatex

You may also change the LaTeX engine for other document output formats, especially those based on `pdf_document`, such as `bookdown::pdf_document2` and `tufte::tufte_handout`, e.g.,

    output:
      bookdown::pdf_document2:
        latex_engine: lualatex
      tufte::tufte_handout:
        latex_engine: xelatex
