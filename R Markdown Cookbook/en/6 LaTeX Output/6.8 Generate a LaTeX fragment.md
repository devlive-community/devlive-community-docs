If you work primarily with pure LaTeX documents, you may still find R Markdown useful. Sometimes it may be more convenient to write in R Markdown and convert the document to a LaTeX fragment, which can be included in other LaTeX documents.

When you render an Rmd document to LaTeX, it generates a full LaTeX document that includes the `\documentclass{}`, `\begin{body}`, and `\end{body}`. A LaTeX fragment is basically the body of a full LaTeX document. To render a LaTeX fragment, you may use the `latex_fragment` output format, e.g.,

    ---
    output: latex_fragment
    ---

This will render a `.tex` file, e.g., `foo.Rmd` will render `foo.tex`, and you can use `\input{foo.tex}` to include this fragment in another LaTeX document.
