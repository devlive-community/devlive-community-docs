We can use the **titling** LaTeX package to alter our title block to include an image. Below is a full example that shows how to add the R logo (`logo.jpg`) to the title page. The image can be of any format that LaTeX supports (e.g., `jpg`, `png`, or `pdf`).

    title: Adding a Logo to LaTeX Title

      - \usepackage{titling}

      - \posttitle{\end{center}}

    <!-- Optionally include a page break. This will force the start
    of the document to the second page -->

    This is your report.
    
    ```{r, include=FALSE}
    # copy the R logo to the current directory
    file.copy(file.path(R.home("doc"), "html", "logo.jpg"), '.')
    ```

An example output is shown in Figure [6.1](#fig61).

An alternative method that does not require a special LaTeX package (**titling**) is to just insert the image in the `title` field using the Markdown syntax. For example:

    title: |
      ![](logo.jpg){width=1in}  
      Adding a Logo to LaTeX Title

In this case, you will not need the `header-includes` field in the YAML frontmatter in the first example. Please note that although you cannot see them, there are two trailing spaces after `![](logo.jpg){width=1in}`, which means a line break in Markdown (see Section [4.12]($Preserve-A-Large-Number-Of-Line-Breaks)). Without the line break, the image and the title would be on the same line, which may not be what you desire.
