The goal of this text is to showcase many tips and tricks for getting the most value from R Markdown. The following chapters demonstrate techniques to write more efficient and succinct code and to customize your output. Before we begin, it may be helpful to learn just a bit more about how R Markdown works, to help you to understand, remember, apply, and "remix" these tricks. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the process of knitting a document and the "key levers to pull" to change the output. This material is not necessary to understand the subsequent chapters (so feel free to skip ahead!), but it may help you to build a richer mental model for how all the pieces fit together.
