In Section [6.12]($Pandoc-Options-ForLaTeX-Output), we mentioned that if you feel the constraint of Markdown (due to its simplicity) is too strong, you can embed code chunks in a pure LaTeX document instead of Markdown. Similarly, if you are familiar and comfortable with writing raw HTML code, you can intermingle code chunks with HTML, too. Such documents have the conventional filename extension `.Rhtml`.

In an Rhtml document, code chunks are embedded between `<!--begin.rcode` and `end.rcode-->`, and inline R expressions are embedded in `<!--rinline -->`. Below is a full Rhtml example. You can save it to a file named `test.Rhtml`, and use `knitr::knit("test.Rhtml")` to compile it. The output will be an HTML (`.html`) file. In RStudio, you can also hit the `Knit` button on the toolbar to compile the document.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>A minimal knitr example in HTML</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <!--begin.rcode
      knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=5, fig.height=5)
      end.rcode-->
    
      <p>This is a minimal example that shows
      how <strong>knitr</strong> works with pure HTML
      pages.</p>
    
      <p>Boring stuff as usual:</p>
    
    <!--begin.rcode
        # a simple calculator
        1 + 1
        # boring random numbers
        set.seed(123)
        rnorm(5)
        end.rcode-->
    
      <p>We can also produce plots (centered by the
      option <code>fig.align='center'</code>):</p>
    
    <!--begin.rcode cars-scatter, fig.align='center'
        plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
        end.rcode-->
    
      <p>Errors, messages and warnings can be put into
      <code>div</code>s with different <code>class</code>es:</p>
    
    <!--begin.rcode
        sqrt(-1)  # warning
        message('knitr says hello to HTML!')
        1 + 'a'  # mission impossible
        end.rcode-->
    
      <p>Well, everything seems to be working. Let's ask R what is
      the value of &pi;? Of course it is <!--rinline pi -->.</p>
