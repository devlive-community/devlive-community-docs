[TOC]

As an application of the methods mentioned in Section [7.1]($Apply-Custom-CSS), we can use CSS to adjust the alignment of headings. For example, you may center section headings of level 1, 2, and 3 with the CSS code below:

    h1, h2, h3 {
      text-align: center;
    }

Please see Section [7.1]($Apply-Custom-CSS) on how to apply the CSS to your Rmd document.
