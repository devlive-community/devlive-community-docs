If code blocks in the output document are potentially distracting to readers, you may choose to fold them initially. Readers can then choose to display them by clicking the fold buttons:

    output:
      html_document:
        code_folding: hide

You can also choose to unfold all code blocks initially (so readers can choose to fold them later):

    output:
      html_document:
        code_folding: show

If you fold all code blocks initially, you can specify certain blocks to be unfolded initially with the chunk option `class.source = "fold-show"`, e.g.,

    ---
    title: Hide all code blocks and show some initially
    output:
      html_document:
        code_folding: hide
    ---
    
    ```{r}
    1  # code is hidden initially
    ```
    
    ```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
    2  # code is shown initially
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    3  # also hidden
    ```

You can also do it the other way around, i.e., show all code blocks but hide some of them initially. For example:

    ---
    output:
      html_document:
        code_folding: show
    ---
    
    ```{r}
    1  # code is shown initially
    ```
    
    ```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
    2  # code is hidden initially
    ```

`code_folding` will control the hide and show behavior for R code chunks but also for some other languages by default (`r`, `python`, `bash`, `sql`, `cpp`, `stan`, and `julia`). If this is a limitation for you, it can be extended to apply to any language code source block by adding the class `foldable` via the chunk option `class.source`, or even setting it globally so that it applies on any code chunk using `knitr::opts_chunk$set(class.source = "foldable")`.

    title: Hide CSS code chunk
    output: 
      html_document:
        code_folding: hide
    ---
    
    This is a CSS chunk using the `css` chunk engine, and it can't be hidden even if
    `code_folding = 'hide'`.
    
    ```{css}
    pre {
      background-color: lightblue;
    }
    ```
    
    But it can if you add the `foldable` class to the chunk source code. 
    
    ```{css, class.source = 'foldable'}
    pre.foldable {
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }
    ```
