As mentioned in Section [7.4]($Scrollable-Code-Blocks), we can fold source code chunks via the option `code_folding: hide` in the `html_document` format. Currently it is not possible to fold output blocks, but we can use some JavaScript tricks to make output foldable, too. This can be useful especially when the output is relatively long but not very important. We can fold it initially, and, if the reader is interested, they can unfold it to view the content. Figure [7.5](#fig:details-tag) shows an example: you may click on the “Details” button to unfold the output.

If you are viewing the HTML version of this book, you can actually see it in action below. If you are reading the PDF or printed version, such an interaction (clicking the “Details” button) is certainly not possible.

Below is the full source Rmd document that includes the JavaScript code to find output blocks, and wrap them into the `<details>` tags.

    ---
    title: Use the `<details>` disclosure element
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    We show text output inside the `<details>` tags in this
    example. We used JavaScript to wrap text output blocks
    in `<details></details>`. The JavaScript code needs to
    be executed at the end of this document, so it is placed
    at the end. Below is a testing code chunk:
    
    ```{r}
    1:100
    ```
    
    The actual JavaScript code is below.
    
    ```{js, echo=FALSE}
    (function() {
      var codes = document.querySelectorAll('pre:not([class])');
      var code, i, d, s, p;
      for (i = 0; i < codes.length; i++) {
        code = codes[i];
        p = code.parentNode;
        d = document.createElement('details');
        s = document.createElement('summary');
        s.innerText = 'Details';
        // <details><summary>Details</summary></details>
        d.appendChild(s);
        // move the code into <details>
        p.replaceChild(d, code);
        d.appendChild(code);
      }
    })();
    ```

You may try to adapt the JavaScript code above to your own need. The key is to find out the elements to be wrapped into `<details>`:

    document.querySelectorAll('pre:not([class])');

The CSS selector `pre:not([class])` means all `<pre>` elements without the `class` attribute. You can also select other types of elements.
