We can customize the style of code chunks and their text output using the chunk options `class.source` and `class.output`, respectively. These options take character vectors of class names (see Section [11.13]($Add-Attributes-To-Text-Output-Blocks) for more information). For example, when `class.source = "important"`, the HTML element containing the code chunk in the output will have a class `important`. Then you can define CSS rules for this class.<sup>[11](#fn11)</sup> This can be useful when you want to highlight a certain code chunk or its text output.

By default, the HTML output of R Markdown includes the Bootstrap framework, which makes it easy for you to change the appearance of your code and output, because Bootstrap has predefined some [CSS classes for backgrounds:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#helper-classes) `"bg-primary"`, `"bg-success"`, `"bg-info"`, `"bg-warning"`, and `"bg-danger"`.

Below is an example using the chunk options `class.source = "bg-danger"` and `class.output = "bg-warning"`, and you can see its output in Figure [7.1](#fig71).

    When you subset a data frame, it does not necessarily return
    a data frame. For example, if you subset two columns, you get
    a data frame, but when you try to subset one column, you get
    a vector:
    
    ```{r class.source="bg-danger", class.output="bg-warning"}
    mtcars[1:5, "mpg"]
    ```
    
    To make sure that we always get a data frame, we have to use
    the argument `drop = FALSE`. Now we use the chunk option
    `class.source = "bg-success"`.
    
    ```{r df-drop-ok, class.source="bg-success"}
    mtcars[1:5, "mpg", drop = FALSE]
    ```

You can also use arbitrary class names and define CSS rules accordingly. In this case, you will have to include your custom CSS rules using the methods mentioned in Section [7.1]($Apply-Custom-CSS). Below is an example:

    title: Assign custom classes to chunks
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    First we define some CSS rules for a class `watch-out`.
    
    ```{css, echo=FALSE}
    .watch-out {
      background-color: lightpink;
      border: 3px solid red;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```
    
    Then we assign a class `watch-out` to the code chunk via the
    chunk option `class.source`.
    
    ```{r class.source="watch-out"}
    mtcars[1:5, "mpg"]
    ```

The output style is shown in Figure [7.2](#fig72).

If you want all code blocks in the document to use the custom style, you can set `class.source` in the global **knitr** options, e.g.,

    knitr::opts_chunk$set(class.source = "watch-out")

You can apply multiple classes to the code blocks. For example, with `class.source = c("important", "warning")`, the code block will have two classes, “important” and “warning.”

If you want to decorate individual elements in code blocks instead of the whole blocks, you may consider using the **flair** package ([Bodwin and Glanz 2024](#ref-R-flair)). With this package, you can highlight different parts of your code (such as fixed strings, function names, and arguments) with custom styles (e.g., color, font size, and/or font weight).
