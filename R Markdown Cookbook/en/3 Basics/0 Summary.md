In this chapter, we present some key concepts about R Markdown. First, we introduce the basic components of an R Markdown document: the prose and code. Next, we show how to convert R Markdown documents to R scripts, and vice versa.

For those seeking lower-level basics, please read Chapter 2 of the _R Markdown Definitive Guide_ [@rmarkdown2018].
