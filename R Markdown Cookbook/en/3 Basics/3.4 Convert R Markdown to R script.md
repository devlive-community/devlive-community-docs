When you want to extract all R code from an R Markdown document, you can call the function `knitr::purl()`. Below is a simple Rmd example with the filename `purl.Rmd`:

    title: Use `purl()` to extract R code
    ---
    
    The function `knitr::purl()` extracts R code chunks from
    a **knitr** document and save the code to an R script.
    
    Below is a simple chunk:
    
    ```{r, simple, echo=TRUE}
    1 + 1
    ```
    
    Inline R expressions like `r 2 * pi` are ignored by default.
    
    If you do not want certain code chunks to be extracted,
    you can set the chunk option `purl = FALSE`, e.g.,
    
    ```{r, ignored, purl=FALSE}
    x = rnorm(1000)
    ```

If we call `knitr::purl("purl.Rmd")`, it generates the following R script (with the filename `purl.R` by default):

    ## ----simple, echo=TRUE-------------------------------
    1 + 1

The above R script contains the chunk options in a comment. If you want pure R code, you may call `knitr::purl()` with the argument `documentation = 0`, which will generate the R script below:

If you want to retain all the text, you may use the argument `documentation = 2`, which generates the R script below:

    #' The function `knitr::purl()` extracts R code chunks from
    #' a **knitr** document and save the code to an R script.
    #' 
    #' Below is a simple chunk:
    #' 
    ## ----simple, echo=TRUE-------------------------------
    1 + 1
    
    #' 
    #' Inline R expressions like `r 2 * pi` are ignored by default.
    #' 
    #' If you do not want certain code chunks to be extracted,
    #' you can set the chunk option `purl = FALSE`, e.g.,
    #' 

Note that code chunks with the option `purl = FALSE` will be excluded in the R script.

Inline R expressions are ignored by default. If you want to include them in the R script, you need to set the global R option `options(knitr.purl.inline = TRUE)` before calling `knitr::purl()`.
