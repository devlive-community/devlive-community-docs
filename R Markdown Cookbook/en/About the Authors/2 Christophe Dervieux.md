[TOC]

Christophe Dervieux is an active member of the R community, currently living in France. With a master's degree in energy and economics, he started working with R as an analyst doing economic studies about market designs, before becoming a developer advocate and R admin, promoting R and supporting R users where he works.

He is interested in helping others get the most from R, and you can find him wandering in the RStudio Community as a sustainer, or on several GitHub issue boards for various R packages. In both places, you may better recognize him by his shorter handle "cderv."

As an R developer, he is a contributor to several R packages, such as **bookdown**, **rmarkdown**, and **knitr**. He has also co-authored the **crrri** package. His own projects can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/cderv), and sometimes he shares his ideas on Twitter (https://twitter.com/chrisderv).

He does not like spicy food, but he enjoys playing badminton every week.
