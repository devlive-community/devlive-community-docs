The **kableExtra** package ([Zhu 2024](#ref-R-kableExtra)) is designed to extend the basic functionality of tables produced using `knitr::kable()` (see Section [10.1]($The-Function-Knitr-Kable)). Since `knitr::kable()` is simple by design (please feel free to read this as “Yihui is lazy”), it definitely has a lot of missing features that are commonly seen in other packages, and **kableExtra** has filled the gap perfectly. The most amazing thing about **kableExtra** is that most of its table features work for both HTML and PDF formats (e.g., making striped tables like the one in Figure [10.1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html#fig:striped-table)).

This package can be installed from CRAN as usual, or you may try the development version on GitHub ([https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra)):

    # install from CRAN
    install.packages("kableExtra")
    
    # install the development version
    remotes::install_github("haozhu233/kableExtra")

It has extensive documentation at [https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/), which provides a lot of examples on how the `kable()` output can be customized for either HTML or LaTeX output. We recommend that you read its documentation by yourself, and will only present a handful of examples in this section.

The **kableExtra** package features the pipe operator, `%>%`. You can pipe the `kable()` output to the styling functions of **kableExtra**, e.g.,

    library(knitr)
    library(kableExtra)
    kable(iris) %>%
      kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")

### 10.2.1 Set the font size

The function `kable_styling()` in **kableExtra** allows you to style the whole table. For example, you can specify the alignment of the table on the page, the width, and the font size of the table. Below is an example of using a smaller font size:

    kable(head(iris, 5), booktabs = TRUE) %>%
      kable_styling(font_size = 8)

| Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.7 | 3.2 | 1.3 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.6 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 5.0 | 3.6 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |

### 10.2.2 Style specific rows/columns

The functions `row_spec()` and `column_spec()` can be used to style individual rows and columns, respectively. In the example below, we make the first row bold and italic, add a black background to the second and third rows while changing the font color to white, underline the fourth row and change its typeface, rotate the fifth row, and strike out the fifth column:

    kable(head(iris, 5), align = 'c', booktabs = TRUE) %>%
      row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, italic = TRUE) %>% 
      row_spec(2:3, color = 'white', background = 'black') %>%
      row_spec(4, underline = TRUE, monospace = TRUE) %>% 
      row_spec(5, angle = 45) %>% 
      column_spec(5, strikeout = TRUE)

| Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width | Species |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.7 | 3.2 | 1.3 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.6 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 5.0 | 3.6 | 1.4 | 0.2 | setosa |

Similarly, you can style individual cells with the `cell_spec()` function.

### 10.2.3 Group rows/columns

Rows and columns can be grouped via the functions `pack_rows()` and `add_header_above()`, respectively. You can also collapse rows via `collapse_rows()`, so one cell can span multiple rows. Below is an example that shows a custom table header with grouped columns:

    iris2 <- iris[1:5, c(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)]
    names(iris2) <- gsub('[.].+', '', names(iris2))
    kable(iris2, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
      add_header_above(c("Length" = 2, "Width" = 2, " " = 1)) %>% 
      add_header_above(c("Measurements" = 4, "More attributes" = 1))

| Measurements | More attributes |
| --- | --- |
| Length | Width |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sepal | Petal | Sepal | Petal | Species |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | 1.4 | 3.5 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.9 | 1.4 | 3.0 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.7 | 1.3 | 3.2 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 4.6 | 1.5 | 3.1 | 0.2 | setosa |
| 5.0 | 1.4 | 3.6 | 0.2 | setosa |

For the named vector in `add_header_above()`, the names are the text to be shown in the table header, and the integer values of the vector indicate how many columns a name should span, e.g., `"Length" = 2` means `Length` should span two columns.

Below is an example of `pack_rows()`. The meaning of its `index` argument is similar to the argument of `add_header_above()` as we just explained before.

    iris3 <- iris[c(1:2, 51:54, 101:103), ]
    kable(iris3[, 1:4], booktabs = TRUE) %>% pack_rows(
      index = c("setosa" = 2, "versicolor" = 4, "virginica" = 3)
    )

|  | Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **setosa** |
| 1 | 5.1 | 3.5 | 1.4 | 0.2 |
| 2 | 4.9 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 0.2 |
| **versicolor** |
| 51 | 7.0 | 3.2 | 4.7 | 1.4 |
| 52 | 6.4 | 3.2 | 4.5 | 1.5 |
| 53 | 6.9 | 3.1 | 4.9 | 1.5 |
| 54 | 5.5 | 2.3 | 4.0 | 1.3 |
| **virginica** |
| 101 | 6.3 | 3.3 | 6.0 | 2.5 |
| 102 | 5.8 | 2.7 | 5.1 | 1.9 |
| 103 | 7.1 | 3.0 | 5.9 | 2.1 |

### 10.2.4 Scaling down wide tables in LaTeX

There are a few features that are specific to the HTML or LaTeX output format. For example, landscape pages only make sense in LaTeX, so the `landscape()` function in **kableExtra** only works for LaTeX output. Below we show an example to scale down a table to fit the page (otherwise it would be too wide):

    tab <- kable(tail(mtcars, 5), booktabs = TRUE)
    tab  # original table (too wide)


|  | mpg | cyl | disp | hp | drat | wt | qsec | vs | am | gear | carb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lotus Europa | 30.4 | 4 | 95.1 | 113 | 3.77 | 1.513 | 16.9 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 2 |
| Ford Pantera L | 15.8 | 8 | 351.0 | 264 | 4.22 | 3.170 | 14.5 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 4 |
| Ferrari Dino | 19.7 | 6 | 145.0 | 175 | 3.62 | 2.770 | 15.5 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Maserati Bora | 15.0 | 8 | 301.0 | 335 | 3.54 | 3.570 | 14.6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 |
| Volvo 142E | 21.4 | 4 | 121.0 | 109 | 4.11 | 2.780 | 18.6 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 |

    tab %>%
      kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")

|  | mpg | cyl | disp | hp | drat | wt | qsec | vs | am | gear | carb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lotus Europa | 30.4 | 4 | 95.1 | 113 | 3.77 | 1.513 | 16.9 | 1 | 1 | 5 | 2 |
| Ford Pantera L | 15.8 | 8 | 351.0 | 264 | 4.22 | 3.170 | 14.5 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 4 |
| Ferrari Dino | 19.7 | 6 | 145.0 | 175 | 3.62 | 2.770 | 15.5 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Maserati Bora | 15.0 | 8 | 301.0 | 335 | 3.54 | 3.570 | 14.6 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 |
| Volvo 142E | 21.4 | 4 | 121.0 | 109 | 4.11 | 2.780 | 18.6 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 |

You will not see any differences in the above two tables if you are viewing the HTML version.
