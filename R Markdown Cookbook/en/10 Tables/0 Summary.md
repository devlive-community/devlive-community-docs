Tables are one of the primary ways in which we can communicate results in a report. You may often desire to tweak their appearance to suit your particular needs. In this chapter, we will introduce techniques that can be used to customize tables. This chapter aims to do the following:

*   Show all features of the table-generating function `knitr::kable()`.

*   Highlight more advanced customization of tables using the **kableExtra** package ([Zhu 2024](#ref-R-kableExtra)).

*   Provide a list of other packages that produce tables.
