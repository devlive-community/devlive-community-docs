*   Setup [develop environment]($IntelliJ-IDEA-Setup-Guide) on your machine
*   [Build]($Building-From-Source) Kyuubi from source
*   [Run tests]($Running-Tests) locally
*   [Submit a pull request](https://kyuubi.apache.org/pull_request.html) through Github
*   Be listed in [Apache Kyuubi contributors](https://github.com/apache/kyuubi/graphs/contributors)

*   sub-tasks of an ongoing shorthanded umbrella
*   non-urgent improvements
*   bug fixes for corner cases
*   feature requests not covered by current technology stack of kyuubi community

Since these problems are not urgent, you can take your time when fixing them.

> Help wanted issues may contain easy pickings and tricky ones.
