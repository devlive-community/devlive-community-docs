[TOC]

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to compute engines including Spark, Trino, PrestoDB, Flink, Hive and Impala using a high-performance table format that works just like a SQL table.

> This article assumes that you have mastered the basic knowledge and operation of [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/). For the knowledge about Iceberg not mentioned in this article, you can obtain it from its [Official Documentation](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/).

By using kyuubi, we can run SQL queries towards Iceberg which is more convenient, easy to understand, and easy to expand than directly using hive to manipulate Iceberg.

Iceberg Integration
---

To enable the integration of kyuubi hive sql engine and Iceberg, you need to:

*   Referencing the Iceberg [dependencies](#hive-iceberg-deps)
*   Setting the hive extension and catalog [configurations](#hive-iceberg-conf)

### Dependencies

The **classpath** of kyuubi hive sql engine with Iceberg supported consists of

1.  kyuubi-hive-sql-engine-1.9.1_2.12.jar, the engine jar deployed with Kyuubi distributions
2.  a copy of hive distribution
3.  iceberg-hive-runtime-<hive.version>_<scala.version>-<iceberg.version>.jar (example: iceberg-hive-runtime-3.2\_2.12-0.14.0.jar), which can be found in the [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.iceberg)

In order to make the Iceberg packages visible for the runtime classpath of engines, we can use the method:

1.  Execute ADD JAR statement in the Kyuubi to add dependencies to Hiveâ€™s auxiliary classpath. For example:

```sql
ADD JAR /path/to/iceberg-hive-runtime.jar;
```

> Please mind the compatibility of different Iceberg and Hive versions, which can be confirmed on the page of [Iceberg multi engine support](https://iceberg.apache.org/multi-engine-support/).

### Configurations

To activate functionality of Iceberg, we can set the following configurations: Set `iceberg.engine.hive.enabled=true` in the Hadoop configuration. For example, setting this in the hive-site.xml

Iceberg Operations
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking `CREATE TABLE` as a example,

```sql
CREATE TABLE x (i int) STORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler';
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE x (i int) STORED BY 'org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler';
```

Taking `SELECT` as a example,

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo;
```

Taking `INSERT` as a example,

```sql
INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c');
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE target SELECT * FROM source;
```

Taking `ALTER` as a example,

```sql
ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES('...'='...');
```
