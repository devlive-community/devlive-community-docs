Self-hosted
-----------

You get all the features in the self-hosted version, but you need to take care of the maintenance of Coolify and all related services.

### Benefits of the self-hosted option

*   **No Hidden Costs.** Cloud providers can become costly once you surpass the free tier. Once you go beyond the free tier, expenses can accumulate rapidly. There are plenty of [horror stories](https://serverlesshorrors.com/).
*   **Cost Efficient.** You get way more resources for your money and you can save a lot (thousands of $) every month, like [this](https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1742078215986860460) and [this](https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1752209429276086688) and [this](https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1724510876256944244).
*   **Easier Than You Think.** Servers (hardware + software) have changed a lot since cloud providers emerged. And with software (like Coolify), you can start hosting in minutes without any maintanence work.
*   **Data Privacy.** Currently, data privacy is a major issue. By self-hosting, you have complete control over your data and can guarantee that it is not being misused.
*   **No Features Behind Paywall.** Everything is included in the open-source software (OSS) version. And will always be.
*   **No Limitations.** You have the freedom to host an unlimited number of websites on any quantity of servers without any restrictions.
*   **Nice UI.** You get a simple and easy to use UI to manage your servers and applications.
*   **Open Source.** You can see the source code and contribute to it, if you want. You can shape the future of the software.
