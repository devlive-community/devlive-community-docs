### JIRA

The JDO project uses [JIRA](http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10630) to track issues.

We use the following workflow for our JIRA issues:

> Open→Resolved(<→Reopened)→Closed

> When the engineer has fixed an issue, they set the issue to resolved. The submitter can reopen it if there is some problem with it. When the release in which the issue is fixed ships, the issue is set to closed.

> If the same issue comes up again after release, another JIRA is opened, referring to the original issue. This accommodates fixes being backported (if ever necessary) to dot releases after the original release ships.
