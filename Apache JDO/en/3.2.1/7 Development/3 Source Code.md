## JDO Source Code

### Source Code Version Control

The ASF operates a dual hosting system for repositories that use [git](https://git-scm.com/) as their primary version control system. This means committers may commit to either [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/db-jdo.git) or [gitbox.apache.org](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/db-jdo.git). Changes are automatically mirrored to the other repository.
